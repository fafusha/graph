## Graph Implementaion




This Graph Object Implementation Module, offers efficient implementation of graphs by taking advantage of dic and set data
types in Python. This module supports weighted, unweigthed, directed and undirected graphs. It takes advantage of Python's
set.difference_update(t), which allows to reduce time complexity in removing verticies from undirected graphs. his module is
easy to use and simplifies algorithm implementation. It is efficient and can be potentially usefull for debugging algorithms on graphs. The 
module also has useful algorithms built in to it and has graph visualisation implementation in the works.

Sample code can be found in the repository.
