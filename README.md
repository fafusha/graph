##Graph Module Objects\n
This Graph Object Implementation module, offers efficient implementation of graphs by taking advantage of dic and set data
types in Python. This module supports weighted, unweigthed, directed and undirected graphs. It takes advantage of Python's
set.difference_update(t), which allows to reduce time complexity in removing verticies from undirected graphs. 

Sample code can be fouin in the repository.
