# Graph
## What is a Graph?
Graphs are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of 
vertices which are connected by edges and are used to model pairwise relations between objects. 

A concept of a graph was first discussed by Leonhard Euler in 1736 during his work in the Russian Empire.

## Graph Implementaion
This Graph Object Implementation Module, offers efficient implementation of graphs by taking advantage of dic and set data
types in Python. This module supports weighted, unweigthed, directed and undirected graphs. It takes advantage of Python's
set.difference_update(t), which allows to reduce time complexity in removing verticies from undirected graphs. his module is
easy to use and simplifies algorithm implementation. It is efficient and can be potentially usefull for debugging algorithms 
on graphs. The module also has useful algorithms built in to it and has graph visualisation implementation in the works.

Sample code can be found in the repository.
